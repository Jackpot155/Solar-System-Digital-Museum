                    <p>The Solar System is a remarkable network of celestial bodies bound together by the gravity of the Sun. It includes eight planets, their moons, dwarf planets, asteroids, and comets; each moving in a delicate balance through space. From the scorching surface of Mercury to the icy edges beyond Neptune, every world tells a story about the origins of our universe. Studying the Solar System allows us to uncover how planets form, how life became possible on Earth, and what secrets still lie hidden among the stars.</p>

                    <h2 class="head2">The Sun</h2>

                    <p>The Sun is the heart of our Solar System, a massive ball of glowing plasma that provides the energy necessary for life on Earth. Composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, it generates energy through nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium and releasing vast amounts of light and heat. The Sun's gravitational pull keeps the planets, asteroids, and comets in orbit around it. Its activity, including solar flares and sunspots, can influence space weather and impact satellite communications on Earth. Understanding the Sun is crucial for comprehending the dynamics of our Solar System and the conditions that support life.</p>

                    <h2 class="head2">The Planets</h2>
                    <p>Our Solar System is home to eight unique planets, divided into two main groups. <br>
                     <br>
                     <strong>The inner planets: </strong><br>
                     Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars are rocky and relatively small, with solid surfaces. <br>
                     <br>
                     <strong> The outer planets:</strong><br>
                     Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are much larger, composed mostly of gas or ice, and are surrounded by numerous moons. <br>
                     <br>
                     Each planet has its own distinct characteristics, from Saturn's iconic rings to Neptune's deep blue winds, making our planetary neighborhood diverse and fascinating.

                    <section id="mercury">
                        <h3 class="head3">Mercury</h3>
                        <p>Mercury is the smallest and closest planet to the Sun. It has a rocky surface covered with craters, similar to our Moon. Due to its proximity to the Sun, temperatures on Mercury can soar to 800 degrees Fahrenheit (430 degrees Celsius) during the day and plummet to -290 degrees Fahrenheit (-180 degrees Celsius) at night. Mercury has a very thin atmosphere, which means it cannot retain heat. It has no moons and completes an orbit around the Sun in just 88 Earth days.</p>

                    <section id="venus">
                        <h3 class="head3">Venus</h3>
                        <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is similar in size to Earth. It has a thick atmosphere made mostly of carbon dioxide, creating a runaway greenhouse effect that makes it the hottest planet in the Solar System, with surface temperatures around 900°F (475°C). Venus rotates slowly in the opposite direction of most planets, has no moons, and completes an orbit around the Sun in 225 Earth days.</p>

                        <h3 class="head3">Earth</h3>
                        <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to support life. Its surface is mostly covered by water, and it has a protective atmosphere made of nitrogen and oxygen. Earth has one moon and takes 365.25 days to orbit the Sun. The planet's rotation and atmosphere help maintain a stable climate suitable for life.</p>

                        <p>Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is known as the Red Planet due to its iron-rich soil. It has a thin atmosphere mostly of carbon dioxide, making it very cold with surface temperatures averaging -81°F (-63°C). Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, and completes an orbit around the Sun in 687 Earth days.</p>

                        <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and an ice giant. It has a pale blue color due to methane in its atmosphere. Unlike most planets, Uranus rotates on its side, giving it extreme seasons that last over 20 years. It has a faint ring system and 27 known moons, including Titania and Oberon. Uranus takes about 84 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun</p>

                        <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun. It is an ice giant with a deep blue color caused by methane in its atmosphere. Neptune has strong winds and 14 known moons, including Triton. It takes 165 Earth years to orbit the Sun, making it the slowest orbiting planet.</p>

                    <h2 class="head2">Dwarf Planets</h2>
                    <p>Dwarf planets are small celestial bodies that orbit the Sun but are not large enough to clear other debris from their orbits. They share many characteristics with the main planets, such as having a roughly spherical shape, but are generally smaller and found in distant regions like the Kuiper Belt. Well-known examples include Pluto, Ceres, Eris, Haumea, and Makemake. Despite their size, these icy and rocky worlds help scientists understand the early formation of our Solar System.</p>

                            <p>Natural satellites, or moons, are celestial bodies that orbit planets and dwarf planets. They come in many sizes and compositions, from Earth's large rocky Moon to Jupiter's icy moons like Europa and Ganymede. Some moons have active volcanoes, while others may hide oceans beneath their surfaces. These diverse worlds provide valuable clues about the formation and evolution of their parent planets and the Solar System as a whole.</p>
